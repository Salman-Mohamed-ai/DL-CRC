# DL-CRC
This file includes the code and images that are used to find the optimized Deep Learning architectures for the classification of Colon Cancer diagnosis using Whole Slide Images

## Dataset_Sample
It includes sample images of histopathological images of benign and malignant tumor categories.

## Data Analysis.ipynb
This ipynb file includes the basic data analysis steps, that show statistical analysis of the images as well as including keypoint detection and histograms to fully analyze and compare the images.

## Pre-Processing.ipynb
This is the second step, which includes visualizations of the preprocessed images to compare between the original and the preprocessed and augmented image.

## Deep Learning Models.ipynb
This is the main code, where the deep learning models are designed, built, and trained as well as merged to create the ensemble model and finally the results are showcased.
